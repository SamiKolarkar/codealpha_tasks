This Java console program processes student grades entered as a single comma-separated string. It performs the following tasks:
1.Accepts user input in the form of one comma-separated list of grades.
2.Splits the string and converts each value into an integer.
3.Stores all grades in an ArrayList for easy processing.
4.Calculates the average, highest, and lowest grades from the list.
5.Displays the full list of grades along with the computed summary results.
This project provides practice in input handling, string parsing, ArrayList usage, basic calculations, and building simple console-based Java applications.
